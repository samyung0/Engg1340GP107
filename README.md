## <a name="a1"></a> Goal

Your objective is to capture all countries in the map. A country will capitulate once 50% of its land are captured. You also need to stay alive by keeping at least 50% of your land.

___1 second in real life equals 1 day in the game. Non-custom levels will be forced to end when 5 years pass in game (~30 mins).___

## <a name="a2"></a> Progression of game

You can perform the following actions anytime during the game:

1. [Buildings](*buildings)
2. [Researching](*research)
3. [Troops training](*troops)
4. [Army Editing](*army)
5. [Battle planning](*plan)
6. [Battling](*battle)
  
Simply put, getting more buildings will boost your resources available for building more buildings and training troops.

Researching does not take any resources except time which varies from different types, some may give attack bonus or increased farm production just to name a few.

To prepare attacking, you must first train some troops. You may not need to form an army but not doing so will lose some attacking bonus (no organization, etc).

You may also, but not required, to plan the battle line, e.g. immediately attack another connected piece of land after the current one so no reinforcement will arrive so quickly.

The outcome of the battle depends on the types and amount of troops you and the enemy have, the attack bonuses, the air support and the terrain. (refer to [Battling](*battle) for more details)
